# Clojure, Practical.li

![Clojure logo](images/clojure-practicalli-banner.png)

  This is an introduce to the Clojure programming language aimed at those just starting.  Clojure is presented in a simple to understand and highly practical way, so you can evaluate where Clojure is useful in your own projects.

> There are many excellent [books published on Clojure](reference/books.html) that go into detailed theory behind the language, so no need to repeat that here.

## Requirements 

If you wish to try out the Clojure code in this workshop, you will need the following:

  * A working Java runtime environment (JRE) - test with `java -version` in a command line window
  * [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) - test with `lein version` in a command line window
  * A Clojure aware editor with REPL
    - [LightTable](http://lighttable.com/)
    - [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with either [Emacs Live](https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live), [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) or [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)
  * A [Git client](http://git-scm.com/) (optional)
  
  See the [setup](/setup/) section for details on how to get your environment ready

## Code for the workshop

The code for this workshop is contained in the Github repository [Clojure Examples](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-example), the code for each section is in a specific branch.

To get a copy of the repository, use the following git clone command which creates a new directory called clojure-webapps-example that contains the cloned code. 

`git clone https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-example.git`

Once you have the repository, use `git checkout branch-name` to get the code for each section.  Each branch is a working application with all the features covered in that section

Use `git branch` to show all the branches available, they should match the names of the sections in this workshop.

Enjoy.
