# Run the REPL 

  You can try out your new project in Clojure's run time environment, the REPL.

  Inside your project directory, `practicalli` run the following command:  

    lein repl 

  You will see a REPL prompt, where you can enter Clojure expressions for evaluation.  Lets try some simple Clojure:

    (+ 1 2)
    (str "Hello" " " "Clojure world")
    (def author "John Stevenson")
    author
