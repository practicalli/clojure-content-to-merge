# Leiningen Plugins 

  To do more with the Leiningen build automation tool you can install a wide range of [plugins](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Plugins)
  
  Some interesting plugins to look at include:
  
  * [lein-ancient](https://github.com/xsc/lein-ancient) - check your project for outdated dependencies
  * [lein-annotations](https://github.com/bbatsov/lein-annotations) - display TODO's and other notes added to your code
  * [lein-auto](https://github.com/weavejester/lein-auto) - automatically runs a task on file system change
  * [lein-checkall](https://github.com/itang/lein-checkall) - runs lint & other code checks
  * [lein-gitify](https://github.com/Raynes/lein-gitify) - version your project with Git & create a Github repo
  * [lein-speclj](https://github.com/slagyr/speclj) - speckle, a BDD/TDD testing framework
  * [lein-heroku-deploy](https://github.com/maxprokopiev/lein-heroku-deploy) - use maintenance mode whilst deploying to [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

#### Using plugins

  Add to your Leiningen profile.  Edit the file `~/.lein/profiles.clj` and add the names of plugins you wish to use as a Clojure vector
  
> **Comment** Each plugin page should give an example of how to add that plugin to your Leiningen profile.
