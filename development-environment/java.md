## Running Clojure applications

As Clojure runs on top of Java, you will need to have a Java Runtime Edition (usually installed on most computers by default) to run any Clojure applications.

To test if you have Java on your computer, open a command line window and run the command

    java -version


## Building Clojure applications

  Clojure is a compiled language, in fact when your developing your Clojure app it is being compiled all the time.  As we run Clojure on the Java Virtual Machine, your Clojure code is compiled into Java bytecode.
  
  So in order to develop Clojure, you must have either OpenJDK or Oracle SE (JDK) installed, version 7 or 8 recommended.
  
    javac -version


## Installing a Java Software Development Kit (Java SDK)

> **Note** Download and install the latest Oracle Java SDK (version 1.8 at time of writing).


**Open JDK**
