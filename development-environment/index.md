# Development Environment

  Just with other languages, there are many development tools you can use to support your Clojure development.
  
  The most commonly used tool is Leiningen, the build automation tool.  This is used to manage nearly all Clojure projects.  
  
  Maven can be used and may be prefered when developing a project using both Java and Clojure apps (rather than just calling Java from Clojure).
  

#### Typical setups

  Some typical setups I have seen in use for Clojure development are:

* **Modern** - LightTable, Leiningen, Git
* **Live** - Emacs, Emacs Live (with Cider), Leiningen, magit
* **Classic** - Emacs, Cider, Leiningen, magit
* **Ubiquitous** - Vim, nailgun, Leiningen, Git 
* **Intellij** - IntelliJ, LaClojure
* **Nightcode** - Nightcode, Leiningen, Git 
* **Eclipse** - Eclipse, Counterclockwise, eGit/Git
* **Lightweight** - SublimeText, Leiningen, Git 
* **Hardcore** - Leiningen, cat, scp (_only joking_)

  There may be many more variations, however you should find a development environment with the following features:
  
  * REPL 
  * Syntax highlighting, including coloured brackets (eg. rainbow-delimiters in Emacs)
  * autocomplete
