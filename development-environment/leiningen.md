> **Note** Install Leiningen and test it works

  Download the install script from [leiningen.org](http://leiningen.org/) and run the Leiningen script in a terminal

  On Linux and MacOSX, make the script executable first

    chmod a+x lein
    ./lein

  Test that Leiningen is installed with the following command

    lein version

  Output should look similar to:
