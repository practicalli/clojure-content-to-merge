# Other Development tools for Clojure 

Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine so its not surprising that there is good support for Clojure in the major Java IDEs.

## Emacs / Spacemacs

Emacs has always given great Clojure support and is a very powerfull tool for Clojure & Clojurescript development.

The easiest way to set Emacs up as a Clojure tool is to use Spacemacs and add the Clojure layer to the `.spacemacs` file once Spacemacs has been installed.

Recommended Emacs version 24.4 or any greater minor version (Emacs 25.x is a bit too new just yet)

> On MacOSX a really old version of emacs is installed by default (version 22.x).  This should not be used and you may have to rename the exectuable if you want to run emacs from the command line.  Alternatively, create an ailas for emacs in your profie that points to the right version.

## InteliJ

![Cursive Clojure](../images/cursive-clojure-logo.png)

[Cursive](https://cursiveclojure.com/) is a Clojure IDE that aims to understands your code.  Advanced structural editing, refactorings, VCS integration and much more, all out of the box.  It is currently a standalone tool, although will eventually become an IntelliJ plugin.

[La Clojure](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4050) is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.  Provides Clojure language support: syntax and error highlighting, completion, navigation and refactorings.

## Netbeans 

Netbeans did have great support for Clojure, but unfortunately at the time of writing the Clojure plugin has been unmaintained for so long it is not a viable tool to use for Cojure development.
